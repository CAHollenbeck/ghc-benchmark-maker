THIS IS A MODIFICATION OF QUICKCHECK 2, FOR THE HASKELL '22 PAPER
INVESTIGATING MAGIC NUMBERS: IMPROVING THE INLINING HEURISTIC IN
THE GLASGOW HASKELL COMPILER

FILES WERE LITERALLY COPIED AND PASTED INTO THE GHC-BENCHMARK-MAKER AND THE RANDOM
SEED WAS MODIFIED. UPDATES MAY NEED TO BE MADE TO WORK WITH NEWER PACKAGES.

--------------------------- ORIGINAL README:

This is QuickCheck 2, a library for random testing of program properties.

Install it in the usual way:

$ cabal install

The quickcheck-instances [1] companion package provides instances for types in
Haskell Platform packages at the cost of additional dependencies.

The make-hugs script makes a Hugs-compatible version of QuickCheck.
It may also be useful for other non-GHC implementations.
